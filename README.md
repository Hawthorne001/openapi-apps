# OpenAPI
A directory to be used for OpenAPI specifications and Documentation. Some are made by Shuffle, while other's are contributed or gathered by others. 

**[More than 2500 apps on shuffler.io/search](https://shuffler.io/search)**

## Why?
OpenAPI definitions are usually well hidden on vendors' websites where I've dug some of them up, before adding them here.

## About
Shuffle is an [automation platform](https://shuffler.io) that leverages OpenAPI rather than a proprietary, code specific ecosystem to prevent the lockin issues with current SOAR products. It's based on NSA's [WALKOFF](https://github.com/nsacyber/walkoff), and works well with their platform as well. If something is off, please make a pull request or reach out.

## Contribute
You can contribute an OpenAPI3, OpenAPI2 or Json-Schema specification in either JSON/Yaml format. There is no specific documentation format yet. If you have extra documentation for the app, please add it to /docs with the same name. E.g.
```
discord.yaml
docs/discord.md ## OR without md (below)
docs/discord
```

## Goal
1. Help standardize the API's for each TYPE of product (alerts, tickets)
2. Not having to write custom python code for everything I automate anymore
3. Teach security people about OpenAPI
