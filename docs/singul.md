## Introduction

Build & integrate tools, with a Singul line of code. Instead of building integrations, focus on what actually matters; your product.

Learn about Singul: https://singul.io

## Functionality
The goal of Singul is to make it easy to connect to your tools and achieve what you want to achieve. This is done through running requests for you, e.g. to send messages or list tickets in a standardised way. This means that you avoid vendor lock-in, while retaining a standard dataset and can focusing on building what you want.

**Some common functionality is:**

| Action | Typical Usecases |
| --------------- |  ----------- |
| Listing Tickets | Tool that supports ticketing (Cases / EDR / SIEM) |
| Blocking a Hash/IP/etc | EDR / SIEM | Tool that supports blocking (EDR / SIEM / AV) |
| Isolating a host | MDM and EDR systems |
| Sending a message | Messaging and Emailing |
| Search | Search for anything, anywhere |
| Translating Data | Want magic translation to or from a standard? Use this! :) |

## Standards
We focus on the use of standards - primarily OCSF. We believe OCSF will be widely used in the industry and want to be a part of that move. 
[Standards are and will keep being updated on](https://github.com/shuffle/standards) - which auto-downloads it for you.

You can control your own standards by going to "Files" in Shuffle, then "**translation standards**". These files are editable and control standard translation.

Once you have a standard in place, and have ran a translation, you will end up with files in the "**translation output**" category as well. These are the actual translation files. You may edit them to make any translation more accurate.
